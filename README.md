# MinMax Heap Data Structure

### Purpose:
For this lab, you will implement a Minmax heap in C++.   

### General Requirements:
In  this  assignment, you  will  develop  an  array-based  implementation of a  Minmax  heap.  The initial build of the Minmaxheap should use the top-down approach. No duplicates are allowed to  be  inserted.  Also,  each  time  you  insert/remove  an  element,  you  should  organize  the  heap following the minmax heap property.

### In the Minmax heap:
The root of T will be at the minimum level and the next level should be a maximum level.  Minimum and maximum levels will alternate until all the integers in the data.txt file are inserted into the heap.

Here is where the min and max nodes are located:
    min nodes: even levels (0, 2, 4...)
    max nodes: odd levels (1, 3, 5...)

The Minmax heap methods should be implemented as follows:
  - BuildHeap() - should build the Minmax heap using thetop-down approach.
  - Insert(x) - should insert x into the Minmax heap. This means you should add a new element into the heap. After the insertion of new element, the heap should still satisfy the MinMax heap property.
  - Delete(x)  -  should  delete  the  element  x  from  the  Minmax  heap.  After  deleting  the  element x, the heap should still satisfy the Minmax heap property.
  - MinLevelElements() - should print out the elements of the Minmax heap at even levels in level order.
  - MaxLevelElements() - should print out the elements of the Minmax heap at odd levels in level order. 
  - Exit() â€“ should exit from the program.The file you will read the processes from will be data.txt.
